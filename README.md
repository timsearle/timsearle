Hello 👋 My name is Tim, I've been developing software professionally since 2009! 

I'm incredibly passionate about building applications that put the user experience first - details matter! Interested in building zero-trust systems, securing mobile applications, user data and respecting user privacy.

Currently working on:

- 👨🏻‍💻 Principal Software Engineer [@marksandspencer](https://github.com/marksandspencer) - building authentication APIs for Identity and Access Management, to enable a zero-trust estate, and building out our Developer Platform, with a focus on native mobile engineering team
- 🔨 Building [Altilium](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/altilium/id1560227798) - an iOS application written predominantly in SwiftUI that helps cardiac physiologists optimise the energy outputs of batteries in pacemakers

Older projects:
- 👾 [emul8080r](https://github.com/timsearle/emul8080r) - an Intel 8080 emulator written in Swift
- 📐 [Euclid](https://github.com/timsearle/euclid) - Great-circle mathematics helper library for working easily with Core Location
- 🔴🟢 [Bind](https://github.com/karmarama/bind) - A lightweight implementation of reactive type that you can subscribe to and transform values in a simple stream. An extremely simple way to introduce new engineers to functional reactive programming.

🧗🏻‍♂️If I'm not writing code, I'm rock climbing! Qualified Mountain Training Rock Climbing Instructor, and can often be found lurking around London's many climbing walls, or climbing and instructing at the Southern Sandstone.
